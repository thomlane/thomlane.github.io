          This project is meant to create an AR device that is more intuitive
          and more easliy shared. The project uses a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with
          a camera to capturea a video feed. The video feed will be parsed using
          OpenCV to find a QR code. That QR code describes the data that needs
          to shown at that space. A graphic is then created in unity to match
          the QR code and projected back out. The graphic is placed in the
          scene relative to QR code.

          For the Oregon State shaders course taught by Professor Mike Bailey,
          the final project is choosen by the students. For my project I chose
          to use Gerstner waves created in the vertex shader to simulate waves
          in deep water. The program uses four overlapping waves that can all
          be adjusted individually to create different patterns in the waves.

          This is an API I designed to handle customers in a fictional bowling
          alley and is hosted on GoogleCloud and deployed on Google App Engine.
          By visiting the url the user will be asked to log in through google
          and oAuth2.0. If they are succesful their login token will posted
          onscreen and in the database.

          The documentation listed under docs gives a complete description of
          the API. After logging in, a user can interact with the database by
          sending the requests to the defined endpoints. I used postman to send
          requests and an environment along with a series of tests are included
          in the docs folder.
