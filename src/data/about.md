Hi! My name is Lane, and I'm a software engineer from Oregon who has been living in the Greater Seattle Area for the past few years. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a focus on graphics and simulation from Oregon State University, and I’m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science with a focus on AI and physics simulation at DigiPen Institute of Technology.

My passions include gaming, sports, and music. I’ve played soccer for most of my life and even competed on the men’s soccer team at Southwestern Oregon Community College before transferring to Oregon State. While I still play whenever I can, I’ve recently started exploring new sports—volleyball has been my latest obsession.

Music has also been a big part of my life. I’ve been playing the saxophone since I was 11 and was a member of Church Ladies, a successful blues/funk fusion band in Corvallis, OR, before moving to Seattle. Though I haven’t had many opportunities to play since relocating, I’m hopeful that I’ll find a group to jam with in the future.

Lastly, my greatest passion is video games. Games have been a major influence on my life and were the reason I chose to study computer science. Even after starting my professional career, I wanted to deepen my knowledge of computer science and pursue my love of game development. That drive led me to DigiPen, where I’m now earning my master’s degree and honing my skills in game programming. I see video games as both entertainment and an art form, and I hope to create something meaningful in my lifetime.

When I’m not studying, coding, or gaming, I’m usually spending time with my cats, hanging out with friends, or trying a new hobby. I love exploring new experiences and learning about different topics.

I’m excited to continue growing as a software engineer and gaining as much experience as I can in the industry!
